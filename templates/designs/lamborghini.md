# Design System Inspired by Lamborghini

> Category: Automotive
> Supercar brand. True black surfaces, gold accents, dramatic uppercase typography.

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Lamborghini's website is a cathedral of darkness — a digital stage where jet-black surfaces stretch infinitely and every element emerges from the void like a machine under a spotlight. The page is almost entirely black. Not dark gray, not near-black — true, uncompromising black (`#000000`) that saturates the viewport and refuses to yield. Into this abyss, white type and Lamborghini Gold (`#FFC000`) are deployed with surgical precision, creating a visual language that feels like walking through a nighttime motorsport event where every surface absorbs light except the things that matter.

The hero is a full-viewport video — dark, cinematic, immersive — showing event footage or vehicle reveals with the Lamborghini bull logo floating ethereally above. The navigation is minimal: a centered bull logo, a "MENU" hamburger on the left, and search/bookmark icons on the right, all rendered in white against the black canvas. There are no borders, no visible nav containers, no background color on the header — just white marks floating in darkness. The overall mood is nocturnal luxury: exclusive, theatrical, and deliberately intimidating. Each section transition is a scroll through darkness into the next revelation.

Typography is the voice of this darkness. LamboType — a custom Neo-Grotesk typeface created by Character Type and design agency Strichpunkt — is used for everything from 120px uppercase display headlines to 10px micro labels. Its distinctive 12° angled terminals are inspired by the aerodynamic lines of Lamborghini's super sports cars, and its proportions range from Normal to Ultracompressed width. Headlines SHOUT in uppercase at enormous scales with tight line-heights (0.92 at 120px), creating dense blocks of text that feel stamped from steel. The typeface carries hexagonal geometric DNA — constructed from hexagons, three-armed stars, and circles — that echoes throughout the interface in the hexagonal pause button and UI icons. Built on Bootstrap grid with 68 Element Plus/UI components, the technical infrastructure is substantial beneath the theatrical surface.

**Key Characteristics:**
- True black (`#000000`) dominant surfaces with white and gold as the only relief colors
- LamboType custom Neo-Grotesk font with 12° angled terminals inspired by aerodynamic car lines
- Lamborghini Gold (`#FFC000`) as the sole accent color — used exclusively for primary CTA buttons
- All-uppercase display typography at extreme scales (120px, 80px, 54px) with tight line-heights
- Full-viewport video heroes with cinematic event/vehicle content
- Zero border-radius on buttons — sharp, angular, uncompromising rectangles
- Hexagonal motifs in UI elements (pause button, icon system) echoing brand geometry
- Bootstrap grid system + Element Plus/UI 68 components underneath
- Transparent ghost buttons with white borders at 50% opacity as the secondary CTA pattern

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- **Lamborghini Gold** (`#FFC000`): The signature accent color — a warm, saturated amber-gold (rgb 255, 192, 0) used exclusively for primary action buttons ("Discover More", "Tickets", "Start Configuration"). The only chromatic color in the entire interface, it ignites against the black canvas like a headlight cutting through night
- **Pure White** (`#FFFFFF`): Primary text color on dark surfaces, logo rendering, nav elements, and light-mode button fills — the voice that speaks from the darkness

### Secondary & Accent
- **Dark Gold** (`#917300`): Hover/pressed state for gold buttons — a deep amber (rgb 145, 115, 0) that darkens the gold to signal interaction
- **Gold Text** (`#FFCE3E`): Slightly lighter gold variant (rgb 255, 206, 62) used for inline text accents and highlighted labels
- **Cyan Pulse** (`#29ABE2`): Electric blue-cyan (rgb 41, 171, 226) appearing as an informational accent and interactive element highlight
- **Link Blue** (`#3860BE`): Medium blue (rgb 56, 96, 190) used universally for link hover states across all text colors

### Surface & Background
- **Absolute Black** (`#000000`): The dominant surface color — used for page background, hero sections, header, footer, and most containers
- **Charcoal** (`#202020`): Elevated dark surface (rgb 32, 32, 32) — the primary "dark gray" for cards, panels, and text containers sitting above the black canvas
- **Dark Iron** (`#181818`): Subtle surface variant (rgb 24, 24, 24) — barely distinguishable from black, used for footer and deep sections
- **Overlay Black** (`rgba(0,0,0,0.7)`): Semi-transparent overlay for modals and video dimming
- **Near White** (`#F8F8F8`): Rare light surface (rgb 248, 248, 248) for content blocks in white-mode sections
- **Mist** (`#E6E6E6`): Light gray surface for secondary light-mode containers

### Neutrals & Text
- **Pure White** (`#FFFFFF`): Primary text on dark backgrounds — headlines, body, nav labels
- **Smoke** (`#F5F5F5`): Secondary text on dark surfaces — slightly softer than pure white
- **Graphite** (`#494949`): Dark gray text on light surfaces (rgb 73, 73, 73)
- **Ash** (`#7D7D7D`): Mid-range gray for muted text, timestamps, and metadata (rgb 125, 125, 125)
- **Steel** (`#969696`): Lighter gray for disabled text and subtle labels (rgb 150, 150, 150)
- **Slate** (`#666666`): Alternative mid-gray for secondary content
- **Iron** (`#555555`): Dark mid-gray for body text variants
- **Shadow** (`#313131`): Very dark gray for text on dark surfaces where white is too strong

### Semantic & Accent
- **Cyan Pulse** (`#29ABE2`): Used for informational highlights and interactive feedback
- **Link Blue** (`#3860BE`): Universal hover state for all hyperlinks
- **Teal Action** (`#1EAEDB`): Button hover background for transparent/ghost variants (rgb 30, 174, 219)

### Gradient System
- No explicit gradients in the color palette — the dark-to-light progression is achieved through surface layering: `#000000` → `#181818` → `#202020` → `#494949` → `#7D7D7D`
- Video heroes use natural atmospheric gradients from the content itself
- Top-of-page gradient: subtle dark-to-darker fade at the edges of full-bleed imagery

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Display & UI**: `LamboType`, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Arial — custom Neo-Grotesk typeface by Character Type for Lamborghini's 2024 brand refresh. Available in widths from Normal to Ultracompressed and weights from Light (300) to Black. Features 12° angled terminals inspired by aerodynamic car geometry, hexagonal construction logic, and support for 200+ languages including Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek
- **Fallback/UI**: `Open Sans` — used for some button/form contexts as system fallback
- **No italic variants** observed on the marketing site — the brand voice is always upright

### Hierarchy

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Hero Display | 120px (7.50rem) | 400 | 0.92 | normal | LamboType, uppercase, maximum impact |
| Display 2 | 80px (5.00rem) | 400 | 1.13 | normal | LamboType, uppercase, major section titles |
| Section Title | 54px (3.38rem) | 400 | 1.19 | normal | LamboType, uppercase |
| Sub-section | 40px (2.50rem) | 400 | 1.15 | normal | LamboType, uppercase |
| Feature Heading | 27px (1.69rem) | 400 | 1.37 | normal | LamboType, uppercase |
| Card Title | 24px (1.50rem) | 400 | — | normal | LamboType |
| Body Large | 18px (1.13rem) | 400 | 1.56 | normal | LamboType, mixed case and uppercase variants |
| Body / UI | 16px (1.00rem) | 400/700 | 1.50 | normal/0.16px | LamboType, primary body text |
| Button Large | 16px (1.00rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Gold CTA buttons |
| Button Standard | 14.4px (0.90rem) | 300/700 | 1.00 | 0.14–0.2px | LamboType, uppercase, ghost buttons |
| Button Small | 13px (0.81rem) | 300/500 | 1.20 | 0.13–0.2px | LamboType, compact button variant |
| Caption | 14px (0.88rem) | 600/700 | 1.14–1.50 | -0.42px | LamboType, uppercase, negative tracking |
| Label | 12px (0.75rem) | 400/500 | 1.83 | 0.96px | LamboType, uppercase badges and micro labels |
| Micro | 10px (0.63rem) | 400 | 1.00–2.00 | 0.225px | LamboType, uppercase, smallest text |

### Principles
- **ALL-CAPS is the default voice**: Display and feature headings are universally uppercase. This creates a shouting, commanding tone that matches the brand's aggression
- **Extreme scale range**: From 120px heroes to 10px micro labels — a 12:1 ratio that creates dramatic visual hierarchy
- **Tight line-heights at scale**: Display sizes use 0.92-1.19 line-height, creating dense, compressed blocks of type that feel stamped rather than typeset
- **Weight 400 dominates**: Unlike many design systems that use bold for emphasis, Lamborghini's regular weight carries the headlines — the typeface itself is so distinctive it doesn't need weight variation
- **Negative tracking on captions**: -0.42px letter-spacing on 14px captions creates a compressed, technical aesthetic
- **Positive tracking on micro text**: +0.225px at 10px ensures legibility at the smallest sizes
- **Single typeface discipline**: LamboType handles everything — the 12° angled terminals and hexagonal geometry provide visual coherence across all sizes

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use absolute black (`#000000`) as the primary background — never dark gray as a substitute
- Apply Lamborghini Gold (`#FFC000`) exclusively for primary CTA buttons — never for decorative purposes
- Set all display headings in uppercase with LamboType — the brand voice is always SHOUTING
- Use zero border-radius on buttons and cards — sharp angles are non-negotiable
- Maintain tight line-heights (0.92–1.19) on display type to create dense, architectural text blocks
- Use the transparent ghost button (white border, 50% opacity) as the secondary CTA on dark backgrounds
- Let full-viewport video/photography carry emotional weight — UI is infrastructure, not decoration
- Reserve hexagonal geometry for UI icons and the video control button
- Use weight 400 (regular) for headlines — the typeface is distinctive enough without bold emphasis
- Keep the gray palette achromatic — all neutrals are pure gray without color tinting

### Don't
- Introduce additional accent colors beyond gold — the monochrome-plus-gold system is sacred
- Apply border-radius to buttons or cards — curved edges contradict the angular vehicle aesthetic
- Use LamboType in italic or decorative styles — the brand is always upright and direct
- Add gradients to buttons or surfaces — depth comes from surface layering, not blending
- Use light backgrounds as the primary canvas — darkness is the default state, light is the exception
- Mix lowercase into display headings — the uppercase convention communicates authority and power
- Add hover animations with scale or translate — interactions should be color-only (background/opacity shifts)
- Use Open Sans for display text — LamboType must handle all visible typography
- Create busy layouts with many small elements — Lamborghini's design is about singular, bold statements
- Apply shadows to elements — on a black canvas, shadows are meaningless; use surface color shifts instead

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Quick Color Reference
- Primary CTA: "Lamborghini Gold (#FFC000)"
- Background: "Absolute Black (#000000)"
- Surface: "Charcoal (#202020)"
- Heading text: "Pure White (#FFFFFF)"
- Body text: "Ash (#7D7D7D)"
- Link hover: "Link Blue (#3860BE)"
- Accent: "Cyan Pulse (#29ABE2)"
- Border: "Pure White (#FFFFFF) at 50% opacity"

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a hero section with a full-viewport black background, the model name 'TEMERARIO' in LamboType at 120px uppercase weight 400 white text with 0.92 line-height, centered vertically, with a Lamborghini Gold (#FFC000) 'Discover More' button below — sharp corners, 0px radius, 24px padding, black text"
- "Design a transparent ghost button with 1px solid white border at 50% opacity, white text at 14.4px uppercase with 0.2px letter-spacing, padding 16px, on a black background — hover state changes to Teal Action (#1EAEDB) background with 70% opacity"
- "Build a navigation bar with zero visible background on absolute black, a centered bull logo, 'MENU' text label with hamburger icon on the left, and search + bookmark icons on the right — all in white, sticky position"
- "Create a news card grid on charcoal (#202020) background with white headlines at 27px uppercase, body text in #7D7D7D at 16px, and a white underlined 'Read More' link that turns #3860BE on hover"
- "Design a section divider using a 1px solid bottom border in #202020 on a black canvas — the elevation difference is purely through surface color shift, not shadow"

### Iteration Guide
When refining existing screens generated with this design system:
1. Focus on ONE component at a time — Lamborghini's system is extreme and every element must feel aggressive
2. Reference specific color names and hex codes from this document — the palette has only about 5 active colors
3. Use natural language descriptions, not CSS values — "sharp-cut golden rectangle" not "border-radius: 0px; background: #FFC000"
4. Describe the desired "feel" alongside specific measurements — "floating in total darkness" communicates the black canvas better than "background: #000000"
5. Remember that UPPERCASE IS THE DEFAULT — if text isn't uppercase at display sizes, it probably should be
